**The following instructions are required for the tests to pass**

- `Home` should consist of "/" in the URL path
- `Products` should consist of "/products" in the URL path
- `ProductDetails` should consist of "/products/id" in the URL path
- No need to use the `BrowserRouter` in `App.js` as we have already included in `index.js` file

</details>

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
